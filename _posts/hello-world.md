## Programming
Data science, which to some extent deals with programming, is usually done with languages like Python and R due to their high versatility and great amount of libraries. Python has gained more popularity due to its great readability, but partly because there is a big ecosystem for data-science-related tools created around Python, including libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. R boasts outstanding functions to solve statistical tasks ranging from a great width of applications in the domain of data analytics and visualization.

## Statistical Analysis
Knowledge of statistics will arm the data scientist with the correct interpretation for insights into the data. It ranges from probability and distribution to hypothesis testing and regression analysis. Statistical analysis will help the data scientist make better decisions with data. With it, they will also know how to find patterns or trends.

## Data Wrangling
Wrangling Data is the conversion of the raw data into something usable. Essentially, it's a must-have skill because real-world data are usually dirty and incomplete. A data scientist should handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies with ease to assure the quality of the analyses.

## Machine Learning
 Machine learning is sometimes thought of as the very heart of data science, since it allows for the development of predictive models capable of learning from data to make predictions. A few basic machine learning algorithms a data scientist should know are linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Something that would further the effectiveness of deploying machine learning algorithms would be to understand principles of model evaluation and validation. That would ensure the validity and accuracy of a machinle learning model's developed.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the art of setting data in such a context that the data becomes more understandable and interpretable to non-data-scientists. Common tools used for this include Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau-create, information-rich, beautiful charts and graphs. Good data visualization serves to drive insight and communicate among stakeholders, inform decisions, and take control of recommendations by data.

## Domain Knowledge
Domain knowledge provides background understanding of the particular vertical or industry where data science will be applied. Having an understanding of the context and nuances inherent in the data goes a long way in extending the usefulness of analytics and relevance of insights. This will also help the data scientists frame the right question and interpret the results correctly.

## Advanced Data Science Techniques
While this core skill set is necessary, a future data scientist should not be ignorant of other advanced techniques that have the potential to enhance their capabilities and take them to the leading edge of the profession.

## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a class of machine learning that involves neural networks with a large number of layers. By doing so, complex patterns in information can be modeled. Image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous systems-countless. New frontiers opened by functionality in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are usefull tools for deep learning.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is the interaction of a computer with human language. It is the ability that enables machines to make sense of, interpret, and generate human languages; therefore, this constitutes an important component in the applications that involve chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. The knowledge in NLP techniques and tools such as NLTK and spaCy provides an added advantage for data scientists who operate with text data.

## Big Data Technologies
The volume of data is growing continuously, and hence big data technologies such as Hadoop and Apache Spark have become an indispensable part of handling and analyzing large volumes of data. These tools enable the data scientist to handle massive amounts of data with efficiency and perform complex computations over distributed systems.

## Data Ethics and Privacy
There has been an increased collection and analysis of personal data, and, as such, the need to understand data ethics and privacy becomes larger every year. Data scientists should know about ethical considerations to be taken into consideration, such as bias in algorithms, their responsible usage, and observation of regulations: GDPR and CCPA.
